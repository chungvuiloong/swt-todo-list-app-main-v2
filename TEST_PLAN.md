# Test Plan for Todo List Application

## Overview
This test plan outlines the testing strategy for the Todo List web application, a full-stack application built with Astro/SolidJS frontend, FastAPI backend, and PostgreSQL database.

## Framework Selection
**End-to-End Testing Framework**: Robot Framework
- Cross-browser testing capabilities with SeleniumLibrary
- Keyword-driven testing approach for maintainability
- Excellent reporting and logging features
- Built-in test isolation and parallelization

**API Testing Framework**: Robot Framework with RequestsLibrary
- Unified testing framework for both E2E and API testing
- Keyword-driven approach for API testing
- Rich assertion capabilities and detailed reporting
- Easy integration with existing test infrastructure

## Testing Schedule
1. **Week 1**: Test environment setup and basic smoke tests
2. **Week 2**: Core functionality testing (user authentication, CRUD operations)
3. **Week 3**: Advanced features testing (sharing, real-time updates)
4. **Week 4**: Integration testing and CI/CD pipeline setup

## In Scope

### Functional Testing
- **User Authentication**: Registration, login, logout functionality
- **Todo List Management**: Create, read, update, delete todo lists
- **Todo Item Management**: Create, read, update, delete todo items within lists
- **List Cloning**: Copy all items to a new list
- **List Sharing**: Share lists with other users
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket functionality for shared lists

### API Testing
- **REST API Endpoints**: All CRUD operations for users, lists, and items
- **Authentication**: JWT token validation and authorization
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error responses
- **Data Validation**: Request/response schema validation

### End-to-End Testing
- **Happy Path User Stories**: Complete user workflows from registration to list management
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop layouts
- **Session Management**: Login persistence and logout behavior

### Integration Testing
- **Database Integration**: Data persistence and retrieval
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time updates between clients
- **Service Communication**: Frontend-backend API communication

## Out of Scope

### Performance Testing
- Load testing with multiple concurrent users
- Database performance under heavy load
- WebSocket connection limits and scalability
- Memory usage profiling and optimization

### Security Testing
- SQL injection vulnerability testing
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attack prevention
- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection
- Authentication bypass attempts
- Input sanitization comprehensive testing

### Accessibility Testing
- WCAG 2.1 compliance testing
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Color contrast validation

### Browser Compatibility
- Legacy browser support (IE, older versions)
- Mobile browser testing on actual devices
- PWA (Progressive Web App) functionality

### Infrastructure Testing
- Docker container orchestration testing
- Database migration rollback testing
- Backup and recovery procedures
- SSL/TLS certificate validation

### Comprehensive Error Scenarios
- Network failure handling
- Database connection failures
- Third-party service outages
- Edge cases with malformed data

## Test Improvement Ideas (Out of Scope)

### End-to-End Test Enhancements
- **Test Data Management**: Implement database seeding and cleanup strategies for consistent test states
- **Page Object Model**: Create reusable page objects to improve test maintainability
- **Visual Regression Testing**: Add screenshot comparison to catch UI changes
- **Test Reporting**: Enhanced reporting with screenshots and videos for failed tests
- **Parallel Execution**: Optimize test execution across multiple browsers simultaneously

### API Test Enhancements
- **Contract Testing**: Implement API contract testing to ensure frontend-backend compatibility
- **Test Data Factories**: Create factory patterns for generating test data
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Add response time assertions to API tests
- **Security Testing Integration**: Automated security scanning in API tests
- **Mock Services**: Create mock external services for isolated testing

### General Testing Improvements
- **Test Environment Management**: Automated test environment provisioning and teardown
- **Test Metrics Collection**: Track test execution metrics and flakiness
- **Continuous Integration**: Integration with code coverage reporting
- **Test Documentation**: Automated test case documentation generation

## Success Criteria
- All in-scope functional tests pass
- API tests achieve 100% endpoint coverage
- E2E tests cover all critical user journeys
- CI/CD pipeline executes tests automatically on code changes
- Test execution time remains under 15 minutes for full suite
